# Phelpser - crawl your website for 404s

This is a super simple tool to crawl (see? a swimming pun!) your website (or
somebody elses) for finding outdated URLs.

It might not be the fastest tool, but it works just fine for smaller websites.

## Usage

```bash
yarn add --global phelpser
phelpser your-website.com
```
