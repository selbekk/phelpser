# Phelpser - crawl your website for 404s

This is a super simple tool to crawl (see? a swimming pun!) your website (or somebody elses) for 404s.

It might not be the fastest tool, but it works just fine :)

## Usage

```bash
yarn add --global phelpser
phelpser http://www.your-website.com
```

It's still pretty stupid, so you have to add the protocol (http or https) and what not.
